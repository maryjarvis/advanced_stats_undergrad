# Ordinal Logistic Regression – Maternal Insomnia During the Pandemic

## 📘 Overview
This project uses ordinal logistic regression to model levels of insomnia severity among postpartum mothers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict ordered insomnia severity based on age, employment, and pandemic stage
- Check assumptions like proportional odds
- Interpret odds ratios and category thresholds

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- R (MASS::polr, tidyverse)
- Ordinal regression interpretation
- Model assumption diagnostics

## 📁 Files
- `project4.Rmd` – model code
- `Copy_of_Dataset_Miranda_et_al.csv` – dataset 
- `project4.pdf` – summary report

## 📌 Outcome
The analysis confirmed that maternal age and employment status were significant predictors of insomnia severity, with higher risk linked to early pandemic stages and unemployment.
