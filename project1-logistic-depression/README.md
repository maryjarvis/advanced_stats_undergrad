# Binary Logistic Regression – Predicting Depression in Healthcare Workers

## 📘 Overview
This project uses binary logistic regression to model the likelihood of depression among healthcare workers based on job type, age, and family status during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Investigate the relationship between job role and mental health
- Model interaction between job type and family status
- Capture non-linear age effects with quadratic terms
- Evaluate model fit using AIC and likelihood ratio tests

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- R (glm, tidyverse)
- Model diagnostics and assumptions checking
- AIC-based model comparison

## 📁 Files
- `logistic_model.Rmd` – main model code
- `report.pdf` – summary of findings
- `depression_data.csv` 

## 📌 Outcome
Identified significant predictors of depression and visualised interaction effects, aiding understanding of workforce mental health risks.
