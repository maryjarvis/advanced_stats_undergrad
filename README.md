# Advanced Statistics 3 Portfolio 

This repository presents a dedicated portfolio of statistical modelling projects completed as part of my **Advanced Statistics 3** module during my undergraduate degree in Psychology. Each project applies advanced statistical techniques to real-world COVID-19 datasets, with a strong emphasis on model selection, interpretation, and public health relevance.

## üìå Projects

### 1. Binary Logistic Regression: Predicting Depression in Healthcare Workers
**Description**: Investigated how job type, family status, and age influence depression risk among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Key Points**:
- Interaction between job type and family status
- Non-linear age effects modelled with a quadratic term
- Model fit and deviance comparison using AIC and LRT

### 2. Quasi-Poisson Regression: Physical Exercise and Diet
**Description**: Modelled daily physical activity levels using dietary habits, loneliness, gender, and age.

**Key Points**:
- Underdispersion handled using Quasi-Poisson
- Explored additive and interactive effects of loneliness and diet
- Highlighted the importance of age and health behaviours during lockdown

### 3. Multilevel Regression: Task Demand and Job Categories
**Description**: Used linear mixed-effects modelling to explore variation in perceived task demand across job categories.

**Key Points**:
- Random intercepts and slopes to account for group-level structure
- Job category explained 66% of task demand variance
- Age-related effects differed by role

### 4. Ordinal Logistic Regression: Maternal Insomnia During the Pandemic
**Description**: Analysed severity of insomnia in postpartum mothers using ordinal logistic regression.

**Key Points**:
- Modelled severity across four ordered categories
- Investigated effects of maternal age, employment status, and pandemic duration
- Validated proportional odds assumption and model thresholds
