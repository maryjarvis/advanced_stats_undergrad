# Quasi-Poisson Regression – Physical Exercise and Diet

## 📘 Overview
This project applies quasi-Poisson regression to explore how diet, loneliness, gender, and age influence daily physical exercise frequency during the COVID-19 lockdown.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess how psychosocial and dietary factors affect physical activity
- Handle underdispersion using a quasi-Poisson model
- Investigate additive vs interactive effects between variables

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- R (glm, quasipoisson, tidyverse)
- Comparison of dispersion models
- Visualisation of model predictions

## 📁 Files
- `project2.Rmd` – model code
- `loneliness_original.csv` – dataset
- `project2_count_regression.pdf` – visualised results

health during the covid-19 lockdown in spain. Frontiers in psychology, 12:715792.

## 📌 Outcome
The model revealed that loneliness and diet both influence physical activity, and their interaction highlights how health behaviours shift under stress conditions like lockdowns.
