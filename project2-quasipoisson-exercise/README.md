# Quasi-Poisson Regression – Physical Exercise and Diet

## 📘 Overview
This project applies quasi-Poisson regression to explore how diet, loneliness, gender, and age influence daily physical exercise frequency during the COVID-19 lockdown.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess how psychosocial and dietary factors affect physical activity
- Handle underdispersion using a quasi-Poisson model
- Investigate additive vs interactive effects between variables

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- R (glm, quasipoisson, tidyverse)
- Comparison of dispersion models
- Visualisation of model predictions

## 📁 Files
- `quasipoisson_model.Rmd` – model code and interpretation
- `exercise_data.csv` – clean dataset
- `summary.pdf` – visualised results

## 📌 Outcome
The model revealed that loneliness and diet both influence physical activity, and their interaction highlights how health behaviours shift under stress conditions like lockdowns.
